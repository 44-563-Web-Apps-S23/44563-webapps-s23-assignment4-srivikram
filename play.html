    <h4>HERMANN SUDERMANN</h4>

    <h4>Hermann Sudermann, one of the foremost of the Continental European
        dramatists, was born at Matziken, in East Prussia, Germany, September
        30, 1857. He attended school at Elbing and Tilsit, and then at fourteen
        became a druggist's apprentice. He received his university training at
        Königsberg and Berlin. Soon he devoted his energies to literary work.<br>

        <br>His greatest literary work is in the field of the drama, in which he
        became successful almost instantly. His strength is not in poetic beauty
        and in deep insight into human character, as in the instance of a number
        of other German dramatists. He is essentially a man of the theatre, a
        dramatist, and a technician by instinct. He is a dramatic craftsman of
        the first order.<br>

        <br>His chief one-act plays are in two volumes: _Morituri_, which contains
        _Teja_, _Fritchen_, and _The Eternal Masculine_; and _Roses_, which
        contains _Streaks of Light_, _Margot_, _The Last Visit_, and _The
        Far-Away Princess_.<br>

        <br>_The Far-Away Princess_ is one of the most subtle and most delicate of
        Sudermann's plays. Its technic is exemplary.

    <h5>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS[L]</h5>


    THE PRESENT DAY: _The scene is laid at an inn situated above a
    watering-place in central Germany._<br>

    _The veranda of an inn. The right side of the stage and half of the
    background represent a framework of glass enclosing the veranda.
    The left side and the other half of the background represent the
    stone walls of the house. To the left, in the foreground, a door;
    another door in the background, at the left. On the left, back, a
    buffet and serving-table. Neat little tables and small iron chairs
    for visitors are placed about the veranda. On the right, in the
    centre, a large telescope, standing on a tripod, is directed
    through an open window._ ROSA, _dressed in the costume of the
    country, is arranging flowers on the small tables_. FRAU LINDEMANN,
    _a handsome, stoutish woman in the thirties, hurries in excitedly
    from the left_.<br>
    <h6>FRAU LINDEMANN.</h6>
    <p>There! Now she can come--curtains, bedding--everything
        fresh and clean as new! No, this honor, this unexpected honor--! Barons
        and counts have been here often enough. Even the Russian princes
        sometimes come up from the Springs. I don't bother my head about
        them--they're just like--that!--But a princess--a real princess!</p>
    <h6>ROSA.</h6>
    <p> Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.</p>
    <h6>FRAU LINDEMANN.</h6>
    <p> [_Indignantly._] </p>
    <p>What? What do you mean by that!</p>
    <h6>ROSA.</h6>
    <p> Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That
        student, Herr Strübel, he's always joking. [_Giggles._</p>
    <h6>ROSA. </h6>
    <p>[_Pointedly._] </p>
    <p>He's in such favor at the Inn. He won't be leaving
        here all day.</p>
    <h6>FRAU LINDEMANN.</h6>
    <p> That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only
        knew how I could--Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him--that's the only
        way to manage it!</p>
    <h6>[STRÜBEL _enters.</h6>
    <p> He is a handsome young fellow without much
        polish, but cheerful, unaffected, entirely at his ease, and
        invariably good-natured._</p>
    <h6>STRÜBEL.</h6>
    <p> Good day, everybody.</p>
    <h6>FRAU LINDEMANN. </h6>
    <p>[_Sarcastically._] </p>
    <p>Charming day.</p>
    <h6>STRÜBEL. </h6>
    <p>[_Surprised at her coolness._]</p>
    <p> I say! What's up? Who's been
        rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass of beer, anyway? Glass of
        beer, if you please! Several glasses of beer, if you please. [_Sits
        down._] Pestiferously hot this afternoon.</p>
