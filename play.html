    <h1>Manohar Sri Vikram Vattikuti snips a play</h1>
    <h3 class="name">THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS &nbsp;&nbsp; By &nbsp;&nbsp; HERMANN SUDERMANN</h3>
    <p class="speech">_The Far-Away Princess_ is one of the most subtle and most delicate of
    Sudermann's plays. Its technic is exemplary.</p>
    <h6 class="ROSA">ROSA.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.</p>
    <h6 class="FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN.</h6>
    <p class="direction"> [_Indignantly._] </p>
    <p class="speech">What? What do you mean by that!</p>
    <h6 class="ROSA">ROSA.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That
        student, Herr Strübel, he's always joking. [_Giggles._</p>
    <h6 class="ROSA">ROSA. </h6>
    <p class="direction">[_Pointedly._] </p>
    <p class="speech">He's in such favor at the Inn. He won't be leaving
        here all day.</p>
    <h6 class="FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only
        knew how I could--Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him--that's the only
        way to manage it!</p>
    <h6 class="STRÜBEL"></h6>
    <p class="direction">[STRÜBEL _enters.</p>
    <p class="speech"> He is a handsome young fellow without much
        polish, but cheerful, unaffected, entirely at his ease, and
        invariably good-natured._</p>
    <h6 class="STRÜBEL">STRÜBEL.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Good day, everybody.</p>
    <h6 class="FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN. </h6>
    <p class="direction">[_Sarcastically._] </p>
    <p class="speech">Charming day.</p>
    <h6 class="STRÜBEL">STRÜBEL. </h6>
    <p class="direction">[_Surprised at her coolness._]</p>
    <p class="speech"> I say! What's up? Who's been
        rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass of beer, anyway? Glass of
        beer, if you please! Several glasses of beer, if you please. [_Sits
        down._] Pestiferously hot this afternoon.</p>
