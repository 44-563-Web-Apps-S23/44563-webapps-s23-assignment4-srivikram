    <h4>HERMANN SUDERMANN</h4>

    <h4>Hermann Sudermann, one of the foremost of the Continental European
        dramatists, was born at Matziken, in East Prussia, Germany, September
        30, 1857. He attended school at Elbing and Tilsit, and then at fourteen
        became a druggist's apprentice. He received his university training at
        Königsberg and Berlin. Soon he devoted his energies to literary work.<br>

        <br>His greatest literary work is in the field of the drama, in which he
        became successful almost instantly. His strength is not in poetic beauty
        and in deep insight into human character, as in the instance of a number
        of other German dramatists. He is essentially a man of the theatre, a
        dramatist, and a technician by instinct. He is a dramatic craftsman of
        the first order.<br>

        <br>His chief one-act plays are in two volumes: _Morituri_, which contains
        _Teja_, _Fritchen_, and _The Eternal Masculine_; and _Roses_, which
        contains _Streaks of Light_, _Margot_, _The Last Visit_, and _The
        Far-Away Princess_.<br>

        <br>_The Far-Away Princess_ is one of the most subtle and most delicate of
        Sudermann's plays. Its technic is exemplary.</h4>

    <h5>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS[L]</h5>


    THE PRESENT DAY: _The scene is laid at an inn situated above a
    watering-place in central Germany._<br>

    _The veranda of an inn. The right side of the stage and half of the
    background represent a framework of glass enclosing the veranda.
    The left side and the other half of the background represent the
    stone walls of the house. To the left, in the foreground, a door;
    another door in the background, at the left. On the left, back, a
    buffet and serving-table. Neat little tables and small iron chairs
    for visitors are placed about the veranda. On the right, in the
    centre, a large telescope, standing on a tripod, is directed
    through an open window._ ROSA, _dressed in the costume of the
    country, is arranging flowers on the small tables_. FRAU LINDEMANN,
    _a handsome, stoutish woman in the thirties, hurries in excitedly
    from the left_.<br>
    <br>
    FRAU LINDEMANN. There! Now she can come--curtains, bedding--everything
    fresh and clean as new! No, this honor, this unexpected honor--! Barons
    and counts have been here often enough. Even the Russian princes
    sometimes come up from the Springs. I don't bother my head about
    them--they're just like--that!--But a princess--a real princess!<br>
    <br>ROSA. Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.<br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Indignantly._] What? What do you mean by that!<br>
    <br>ROSA. I was only thinking that a real princess wouldn't be coming to an
    inn like this. Real princesses won't lie on anything but silks and
    velvets. You just wait and see; it's a trick!<br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. Are you going to pretend that the letter isn't genuine;
    that the letter is a forgery?
    <br>
    <br>ROSA. Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That
    student, Herr Strübel, he's always joking. [_Giggles._
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. When Herr Strübel makes a joke he makes a decent joke, a
    real, genuine joke. Oh, of course one has to pretend to be angry
    sometimes--but as for writing a forged letter--My land!--a letter with a
    gold crown on it--there! [_She takes a letter from her waist and
    reads._] "This afternoon Her Highness, the Princess von Geldern, will
    stop at the Fairview Inn, to rest an hour or so before making the
    descent to the Springs. You are requested to have ready a quiet and
    comfortable room, to guard Her Highness from any annoying advances, and,
    above all, to maintain the strictest secrecy regarding this event, as
    otherwise the royal visit will not be repeated. Baroness von Brook, maid
    of honor to Her Highness." Now, what have you got to say?
    <br>
    <br>ROSA. Herr Strübel lent me a book once. A maid of honor came into that,
    too. I'm sure it's a trick!
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Looking out toward the back._] Dear, dear, isn't that
    Herr Strübel now, coming up the hill? To-day of all days! What on earth
    does he always want up here?
    <br>
    <br>ROSA. [_Pointedly._] He's in such favor at the Inn. He won't be leaving
    here all day.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only
    knew how I could--Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him--that's the only
    way to manage it!
    <br>
    <br>[STRÜBEL _enters. He is a handsome young fellow without much
    polish, but cheerful, unaffected, entirely at his ease, and
    invariably good-natured._
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. Good day, everybody.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Sarcastically._] Charming day.
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. [_Surprised at her coolness._] I say! What's up? Who's been
    rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass of beer, anyway? Glass of
    beer, if you please! Several glasses of beer, if you please. [_Sits
    down._] Pestiferously hot this afternoon.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_After a pause._] H'm, H'm.
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. Landlady Linda, dear, why so quiet to-day?
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. In the first place, Herr Strübel, I would have you know
    that my name is Frau Lindemann.
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. Just so.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. And, secondly, if you don't stop your familiarity----
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. [_Singing, as_ ROSA _brings him a glass of beer_.]
    "Beer--beer!"--Heavens and earth, how hot it is! [_Drinks._
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. If you find it so hot, why don't you stay quietly down
    there at the Springs?
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. Ah, my soul thirsts for the heights--my soul thirsts for the
    heights every afternoon. Just as soon as ever my sallow-faced pupil has
    thrown himself down on the couch to give his red corpuscles a chance to
    grow, "I gayly grasp my Alpine staff and mount to my beloved."
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Scornfully._] Bah!
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. Oh, you're thinking that _you_ are my beloved? No, dearest; my
    beloved stays down there. But to get nearer to her, I have to come up
    here--up to your telescope. With the aid of your telescope I can look
    right into her window--see?
    <br>
    <br>ROSA. [_Laughing._] Oh, so that's why----
    <br>
    <br>FRAU LINDEMANN. Perhaps you think I'm interested in all that? Besides,
    I've no more time for you. Moreover, I'm going to have this place
    cleaned right away. Good-by, Herr Strübel. [_Goes out._
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. [_Laughing._] I certainly caught it that time! See here, Rosa,
    what's got into her head?
    <br>
    <br>ROSA. [_Mysteriously._] Ahem, there are crowned heads and other
    heads--and--ahem--there are letters _with_ crowns and letters _without_
    crowns.
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. Letters--? Are you----?
    <br>
    <br>ROSA. There are maids of honor--and other maids! [_Giggles._
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. Permit me. [_Tapping her forehead lightly with his finger._]
    Ow! Ow!
    <br>
    <br>ROSA. What's the matter?
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. Why, your head's on fire. Blow! Blow! And while you are getting
    some salve for my burns, I'll just----
    <br>
    <br>[_Goes to the telescope._
    <br>
    <br>[_Enter_ FRAU VON HALLDORF, LIDDY, _and_ MILLY. FRAU VON HALLDORF
    _is an aristocratic woman, somewhat supercilious and affected_.
    <br>
    <br>LIDDY. Here's the telescope, mother. Now you can see for yourself.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. What a pity that it's in use just now.
    <br>
    <br>STRÜBEL. [_Stepping back._] Oh, I beg of you, ladies--I have plenty of
    time. I can wait.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. [_Condescendingly._] Ah, thanks so much. [_She goes up
    to the telescope, while_ STRÜBEL _returns to his former place_.]
    Waitress! Bring us three glasses of milk.
    <br>
    <br>LIDDY. [_As_ MILLY _languidly drops into a chair_.] Beyond to the right
    is the road, mother.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. Oh, I have found the road, but I see no
    carriage--neither a royal carriage nor any other sort.
    <br>
    <br>LIDDY. Let me look.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. Please do.
    <br>
    <br>LIDDY. It has disappeared now.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. Are you quite sure that it was a royal carriage?
    <br>
    <br>LIDDY. Oh, one has an instinct for that sort of thing, mother. It comes
    to one in the cradle.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. [_As_ MILLY _yawns and sighs aloud_.] Are you sleepy,
    dear?
    <br>
    <br>MILLY. No, only tired. I'm always tired.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. Well, that's just why we are at the Springs. Do as the
    princess does: take the waters religiously.
    <br>
    <br>MILLY. The princess oughtn't to be climbing up such a steep hill either
    on a hot day like this.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. [_More softly._] Well, you know why we are taking all
    this trouble. If, by good luck, we should happen to meet the
    princess----
    <br>
    <br>LIDDY. [_Who has been looking through the telescope._] Oh, there it is
    again!
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. [_Eagerly._] Where? Where?
    <br>
    <br>[_Takes_ LIDDY'S _place_.
    <br>
    <br>LIDDY. It's just coming around the turn at the top.
    <br>
    <br>FRAU V. HALLDORF. Oh, now I see it! Why, there's no one inside!
    <br>
    <br>LIDDY. Well, then she's coming up on foot.
    <br>
