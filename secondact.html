    <p class="speech"> Oh, you're thinking that _you_ are my beloved? No, dearest; my
        beloved stays down there. But to get nearer to her, I have to come up
        here--up to your telescope. With the aid of your telescope I can look
        right into her window--see?</p>

    <p class="direction">[_Laughing._]</p>
    <p class="speech">Oh, so that's why----</p>
    <h6 class="FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Perhaps you think I'm interested in all that? Besides,
        I've no more time for you. Moreover, I'm going to have this place

        crowns.</p>
    <h6 class="STRÜBEL">STRÜBEL. </h6>
    <p class="speech">Letters--? Are you----?</p>
